Mark is usually not shown with two books, as if copying one from another, since the Gospels were divinely inspired. The two books would make sense if it were Jerome, who translated in theory from one book to another.

St. Nicholas, whose legendary acts of charity led to his association with the gift-giving Santa Claus, lived in Myra, a town in modern-day Turkey, and died there in 346. His relics remained there until May 9, 1087, when several citizens of the Italian city of Bari took his bodily remains from Myra and brought them to Bari, where they can be found today. For various reasons that legends always purport to arise from divine providence, the bodies and relics of saints could be moved or 'translated' from one site to another.

The two kneeling figures are the Nurenberg patricians, Paul Volckamer (d. 1505), on the left, and Sebald Schreyer (1446 -1520), on the right, who are identified by the coats of arms at their feet. In addition to honoring the town saint, the image serves as a donor portrait, as the two men commissioned the missal from which this leaf came. | Veneration of Saint Sebaldus|",Parchment,Latin,"Nuremburg, Germany",,,,"Lewis, John Frederick, 1860-1932",http://viaf.org/viaf/63874811,Missal

(Save me, O God, for the waters have come even into my soul), recited at Matins on Thursday. Traditionally, the iconography for the illustration of this psalm calls for the Old Testament king David in the waters praying to God in heaven.

(So that your servants may, with loosened voices, resound the wonders of your deeds), sung at first Vespers for the feast of the Birth of St. John the Baptist (June 24th).

Although secular documents, the iconography of illuminated dogale was usually religious in nature to suggest the approval of divine authority.

Yet, its incomplete state allows us to see the steps of illumination midway through the process. After a leaf was ruled to determine the number of lines of text and decoration, the scribe wrote in the text leaving the areas of decoration blank. The leaf was then handed over to an illuminator who would draw in the outlines of the decoration with a stylus or a lead stick, similar to a pencil. The gold leaf would have been added next before the initial was painted in with various colors.

Overall height of the half-leaf is 23.4, width 32.2 cm. Red staves ruled with a 15mm rastrum. Stave length on verso 210mm, on recto 211mm. Text in a good liturgical gothic.&amp;#x0D; Recto: Complete contratenor part of an Agnus dei on 7 staves. Red text for Agnus 2 probably indicates that it was set as a duet, the Contratenor here serving for that section as the tenor part. This side lacks a capital letter and also lacks the yellow wash used on the verso. Mensurations [O] C O, with void semiminims and red imperfection coloration. Stems of another part (either a tenor with significant minim movement or a different piece) are visible from the missing 8th stave.&amp;#x0D; Verso: First seven staves of the top part of a setting of the Te deum, with red capital T (not indented). Plainsong intonation in red, and chant paraphrase continued in this part. Unsigned tempus perfectum with red imperfection coloration which, on this side of the leaf seems to be partly entered over black or back void notes.&amp;#x0D; No concordances are so far identified. The script shows some variation, and in general appearance the fragment is not unlike the main hand of the lost royal choirbook partially reassembled by Margaret Bent (The Progeny of Old Hall: More Leaves from a Royal English Choirbook, Gordon Athol Anderson (1929-1981) in Memoriam. Musicological Studies 49, vol. 1, 1-54. 2 vols. Henryville, Ottawa, and Binningen: Institute of Mediaeval Music, 1984).

Erasing parchment involved scraping the page (which is animal skin) with pumice or other scraping tools.

Each of the four pages presents, anonymously, part of a different Credo, which means that neither side of the bifolio was originally a centre gathering. Spacing suggests pages were ruled with 12 red staves (of which only the upper 7 survive), allowing each Credo to occupy a single opening, as in Old Hall (Lbl 57950). Two of the Credos have concordances with known compositions, supplying attributions: one to Dunstaple, the other to &amp;#39;Anglicanus&amp;#39;. (These were identified by Peter Wright. See now EECM 55, nos 16, 45, 46). The numbering of the folios (A as the wider leaf and B the smaller) is provisional, as it is not entirely clear which way the bifolio was originally folded. All four pieces are in full black notation with red coloration.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; f. Ar Anglicanus, Credo Alma redemptoris mater (= Curtis &amp; Wathey, Credo 70: Tr92-1, 113v-114).

In imperfect time, major prolation, changing to minor prolation at Et unam.&amp;#x0D; &amp;#x0D; f. Av Dunstaple, Credo, upper part (= Curtis &amp; Wathey, Credo 55, = Ao 15, 135v-138).

Text differently distributed. First section to facta sunt, in imperfect time, minor prolation.
